# Description
A Neovim plugin for toggling the LSP diagnostics. Turn all diagnostics on/off or turn on/off
individual features of diagnostics (virtual text, underline, signs, etc...).

# Compatibility
Neovim >= 0.5.0

# Installation
Install using your favorite plugin manager. 

If you use vim-plug:
```vim
Plug 'WhoIsSethDaniel/toggle-lsp-diagnostics.nvim'
```
Or if you use Vim 8 style packages:
```
cd <plugin dir>
git clone https://github.com/WhoIsSethDaniel/toggle-lsp-diagnostics.nvim
```

# Configuration
Somwhere in your config you should have this:
```lua
require'toggle_lsp_diagnostics'.init()
```
If you are using Vimscript for configuration:
```vim
lua <<EOF
require'toggle_lsp_diagnostics'.init()
EOF
```
You can pass an initial configuration for each of the diagnostic settings:
```lua
require'toggle_lsp_diagnostics'.init({ underline = false, virtual_text = { prefix = "XXX", spacing = 5 }})
```
The above turns off underlining by default and configures the virtual text with a prefix of 'XXX' and five
spaces prior to the virtual text being printed. The complete list of settings may be found in lsp help
page. In particular, `:h set_virtual_text`, `:h set_underline`, `:h set_signs`, and `:h on_publish_diagnostics`.

You can configure diagnostics so that they are off when you first start Neovim:
```lua
require'toggle_lsp_diagnostics'.init({ start_on = false }})
```
Simply toggle them back on when you want to see them.

# Behavior
The toggling is currently done globally. When you turn off all diagnostics you do so for
all buffers / clients both now and in the future. When you turn diagnostics back on the 
same applies.

You can toggle ALL settings, at once, to either on or off by using the appropriate mapping or command.
The `toggle-lsp-diag` mapping toggles ALL settings either on or off. It does NOT toggle back to a 
previous state. So, if you toggle off underline, then turn ALL settings off, and then turn ALL settings
back on again, the underline will re-appear. To get the settings back to the default you can use the 
`toggle-lsp-diag-default` mapping or the `:ToggleDiagDefault` command.

By default *all* of the features are turned on. This means that signs, underlining, virtual 
text, and update in insert are turned on. This is contrary to the Neovim default which has
update in insert turned off by default.

You can change the default settings by passing a configuration to the init() method (see the 
'Configuration' section above).

# Mappings
The following mappings are available. 

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-underline)`
Toggle underlining diagnostic information.

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-signs)`
Toggle displaying signs in the sign column.

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-vtext)`
Toggle displaying virtual text in your code.

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-update_in_insert)`
Toggle updating diagnostic information while in insert mode.

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag)`
Toggle all diagnostics. Turn them all off / on

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-default)`
Set all diagnostics to their default. The default is everything is on, unless other values were
passed to init().

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-on)`
Turn all diagnostics on.

`<Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-off)`
Turn all diagnostics off.

An example configuration:
```vim
nmap <leader>tlu <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-underline)
nmap <leader>tls <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-signs)
nmap <leader>tlv <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-vtext)
nmap <leader>tlp <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-update_in_insert)

nmap <leader>tld  <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag)
nmap <leader>tldd <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-default)
nmap <leader>tldo <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-off)
nmap <leader>tldf <Plug>(toggle-lsp-diag-on)
```
